# Open questions

What is not yet known, roughly in order of how much it would unlock. Each
session's log carries its own "Left open" list; this file is the consolidated
view, kept current at the end of every session.

Solved work lives in [docs/formats/](docs/formats/) and is not repeated here.

**Start here next time: question 1.** After session 10 the whole chain from a
disc image to a moving, textured, scripted scene is readable as *structure*.
What is thin now is *meaning* — 246 of the 253 scene-script opcodes are known
only by number — and the two resources that travel beside a scene, `NODE` and
`SKAC`, are still unopened.

## Now the main line of work

**1. What the SNC opcodes do.** The scene script parses completely and seven
of its 253 opcodes are identified. The rest are known by number, arity and
operand kinds. Two footholds: the 19 opcodes whose signature ends `@@nn`
demonstrably share a trailing structure — 88 690 instructions of 420 532 — and
`0133`, which puts two quaternions in front of that tail, is a rotation tween.
Related, and smaller: the header word at `+0x08`, which matches no count in the
file; the reference spaces `e`, `c`, `k`, `s`, `i`, `u`, `v`, `r`, `g`; what
`m` is; and the five-digit identifier that ends the spawn commands.

**2. `NODE` payloads**, which travel beside every `SCE-` in the same archive
and carry no magic at all. Session 10 looked far enough to see that they are
not scripts: an id, a table of offsets, then floats that read as world bounds
(±5 200). A spatial partition is the obvious guess. Solving this and question 1
together would finish the scene.

**3. Where a `tree`-less scene keeps its skeleton.** 44 objects in the model
corpus have a bone pool that overshoots their own file's node count, and every
one of them sits in a file with no `tree` chunk at all. `SKAC`, which the
census already describes as travelling with skeletons, is the place to look —
and it would also say what an animation binds to when the scene has no tree of
its own, and what a collision file's bone names resolve against.

**4. The ASF chunks nobody has opened:** `ptcl`/`pprn`/`pani` (particles), and
`modf`, `extl`, `PAIF`, `AAIF`, `ACHF`, `glbl`, `mdfr`, `anim`.

**5. The material leftovers**, small and self-contained after session 8: the
two fields in a texture reference at `+0x08` and `+0x0C`, neither of which
separates a colour map from a normal map; the shader program block between a
material's header and its binding table; the 48-byte records counted at
`mats +0x19`, which look like a UV transform; and the four-byte entries in an
`rnel`, presumably how the shading nodes connect.

**6. The AAF leftovers**, small and self-contained after session 9: the word
at `+0x20` which is larger than the file; the three floats at `+0x14` of an
animated track, which look like a time window; the units of time; the channel
numbers other than 5, 6 and 7 — 14, 16, 18, 22, 45 and more, on lights,
emitters and cameras — and the semantic byte at track `+0x12`; and the `0x0200`
that some tracks put in the high half of their size word.

**7. The ACF leftovers**, smaller still: the `u16` at primitive `+0x28`, which
is a permutation of `0 .. n-1` in 460 files and something else in 512; which
bit of the 16-bit collision mask means what; and `+0x2C`, which is exactly the
root sphere seen from the origin on 463 of 972 files and at least that on 779.

**8. The 59 ASF objects in 3 855 whose geometry misses their stated bounding
box** by more than 10 %. They are mostly treasure chests and morph targets —
things whose geometry moves — which suggests the box describes a pose the
stored vertices are not in.

## Smaller and self-contained

9. **AIF mip chains.** The base level decodes. The Xbox 360 packs the small mip
   levels into a shared tile, and working that out would complete the texture
   format.

10. **The AIF flags at `0x34`** (`0x500`, `0x200`, `0x40400`, zero).

11. **`TTD-`**, whose payload begins `DTT\0`. `NODE`, which used to share this
    entry, is now question 2.

12. **The 30 488 bytes at the start of each `ud1.bin`.** Session 7 identified
    the rest of that `0x16000` header as the compiled shader library, 70 of the
    160 shaders in the container. What is left is a per-disc table with a
    `0x100`-byte period, holding no pointers, 51 % of whose blocks are shared
    between the two discs.

13. **The ASF/WMV video runs** in the container gaps — they need splitting into
    individual movies.

14. **`AOF`**, named three times in the engine's RTTI (`Aska::AofHandler`,
    `Aska::AofObject`, `Aska::DirectAofHandler`) but never seen as a payload
    magic on disc. One lead turned up while reading ASF: the chunk holding a
    single object is tagged `ao__`, and `Aska::AofObject` is what the engine
    calls an object. That is a resemblance between two names and nothing more,
    but it is the first place to look.

15. **Disc 2.** Its `SCE-` resources went through session 10's checks alongside
    disc 1's and behave identically, and its audio has the same banks as disc 1
    plus one track disc 1 lacks. The rest of its containers have been walked but
    not put through the same checks.

16. **The `AAC ` leftovers**, small and self-contained after session 5: the
    eight-byte field at `WAVE +0x08`, constant `0x995A7C80_00000015` in 2404
    sounds and zero elsewhere; what the sample count at `+0x24` counts exactly;
    and the `PLBK` playback record, whose shape is known but whose 23 values
    have never been checked against what the engine does with them.

17. **Five missing music tracks** — the numbers 35, 45, 46, 55 and 74 appear on
    neither disc. Cut, or somewhere not yet walked.

18. **The other 90 shaders**, which session 7 did not locate: 160 are counted
    in disc 1's `ud1.bin` and 70 sit in the header block, so the rest are
    presumably inside archives. Related: a shader blob's constant table has a
    structure, and parsing it rather than scanning for strings would give each
    shader its full signature.

19. **The ASF vertex leftovers**, small after session 6: the descriptor nibble
    in slot 3 that two meshes set, and the 24 meshes whose stride is rounded up
    rather than exact. The binormal-or-tangent question is now down to one
    measurement rather than open: with each mesh measured against its own
    material's texture, the plain reading gives a median texel anisotropy of
    1.89 against 5.03 rotated, over 251 914 triangles. Only an actual render
    would close it.
